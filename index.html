      <h2>Our Strengths</h2>
      <div class="strengths-grid">
        <div class="strength-bubble strength1">
          <h3>Deterrence</h3>
          <p>We work with legislators, school districts, and police leadership 
            to strengthen enforcement mechanisms and reduce violations. 
            Our approach combines clear legal authority with precise technology to 
            deliver true deterrence, not symbolic compliance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="strength-bubble strength2">
          <h3>ML-Enhanced Event Capture</h3>
          <p>Our system uses advanced machine-learning tools to document violations 
            with forensic-grade accuracy. Each event is time-synced, encrypted, and 
            preserved according to evidentiary standards to support successful prosecution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="strength-bubble strength3">
          <h3>Collaboration with Law Enforcement</h3>
          <p>PatrolSight™ is built around law-enforcement judgment, not automation. 
            Officers review every case, verify every element of the offense, and maintain 
            full control of the evidentiary chain, ensuring accuracy, fairness, and court-ready documentation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="strength-bubble strength4">
          <h3>Penalization</h3>
          <p>We hold violators accountable through officer-verified citations that 
            meet the highest evidentiary standards. Every case is reviewed by law 
            enforcement, ensuring accurate enforcement, consistent application of 
            the law, and a strong foundation for prosecution.</p>

          <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
          <!-- <h3>At SecuriStop, we strive to end the wide-spread issue of school bus stop sign violations through deterrence and the use of advanced cutting-edge methods.</h3> -->
          <h3>At SecuriStop, we are committed to eliminating illegal school-bus passings 
            through disciplined deterrence, advanced technology, and close partnership with 
            law enforcement.
          </h3>
          <p>We know these violations are preventable, and we refuse to leave children 
            unprotected. Our team is driven because we have seen firsthand what happens 
            when accountability breaks down, and we will not allow that to continue.
          </p>
          <p>We operate the way law enforcement operates: with integrity, precision, and 
            strict adherence to evidence. Our work is shaped by core values that align 
            directly with public-safety standards and prosecutorial expectations.
